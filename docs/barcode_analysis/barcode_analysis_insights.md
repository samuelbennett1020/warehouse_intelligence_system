1. High-Risk Misplaced Items

Observation: Top misplaced items (e.g., 258520, 287049, 297435, etc.) each appear 22 times in the wrong location.

Insight: These items are repeatedly misplaced, likely due to operational confusion or frequent handling.

Action: Introduce double-checks or dedicated bins for these items to reduce errors.

2. Frequent Co-Located Items

Observation: Certain pairs, like 100085715-100153817 and 250231-270954, appear both as top co-located and top misplaced together pairs.

Insight: These items are often moved together, but errors still occur. Their co-location might not be optimal.

Action: Review storage logic—ensure co-located items have clear labeling to reduce misplacement.

3. Popularly Picked Items

Observation: Items like 100080381 are consistently picked together with several others (44 times each).

Insight: These items are frequently picked in combination, likely part of recurring orders or batches.

Action: Place these items close together to reduce picking time and improve efficiency.

4. Misplacement Hotspots

Observation: Some pairs appear frequently in both co-located and misplaced counts (100085715-100153817).

Insight: Certain items are repeatedly mis-shelved or mis-scanned, suggesting problematic storage zones.

Action: Conduct a zone audit to identify where these items are most often misplaced, and improve signage, organization, or training.

5. Items with High Operational Activity

Observation: Top active items (8072660045, RHFL-1062, 198208) are handled often (22 times).

Insight: High-frequency items contribute to both picking and misplacement risks.

Action: Consider priority monitoring for these items—frequent auditing or dedicated staff handling to reduce errors.
